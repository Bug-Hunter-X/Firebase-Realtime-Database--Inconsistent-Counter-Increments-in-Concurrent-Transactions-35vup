# Firebase Realtime Database Transaction Atomicity Issue
This repository demonstrates a bug related to maintaining atomicity when using Firebase Realtime Database transactions to update multiple counters concurrently. The bug arises from a lack of proper error handling and a mechanism to ensure that all updates within a transaction either succeed or fail as a unit.  This can lead to data inconsistency if one update fails while others succeed.

## Bug Description
The code attempts to increment multiple counters at different locations in the Firebase database within a single transaction.  Due to the concurrent nature of these updates and a missing rollback mechanism, race conditions can occur, resulting in inaccurate counter values.

## Solution
The solution introduces robust error handling and ensures the transaction rolls back completely if any operation fails, maintaining data consistency.
