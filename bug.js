The issue stems from an improper use of Firebase's Realtime Database transactions.  When updating multiple locations within a single transaction, ensuring atomicity requires careful handling of data dependencies and potential race conditions.  The provided code attempts to increment counters at different database paths simultaneously, but it lacks proper error handling and a mechanism to guarantee all updates succeed or fail together. If one update fails, the entire transaction should rollback, preventing inconsistencies.
